# RandomForest_Covid19_Case_Study
This is a case study using Random Forest in a multi-classifcation problem to identify the Covid-19 status ('isolated','released',or 'deceased') 
of South Korean hospital patients. Data cleaning included imputing lots of missing values, feature engineering some new categorical variables,
and OneHotEncoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variable before modeling. Feature importances were extracted after modeling to gain
insight as to what what is important in the model.
